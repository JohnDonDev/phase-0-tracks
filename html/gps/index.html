<!-- Semantic tags help to kind of give meaning to your HTML page sections. For screen readers, it helps the whole reading and understanding of the page. It also helps if someone else is going to be working with your HTML, that the semantic tags are there to help them better understand the webpage. I find it a bit hard to decide which one would be the most useful, as they'd all be very useful when actually used properly. Main would obviously be very useful to denote the main content of the webpage. Though, as an aside, I see the aside tag being just as important as main when used properly, and the same for header, footer, and section.

I learned about snippets in sublime, right now I don't know what I'd use them for besides the HTML layout, but I can imagine they will be very useful in the future. It is just a smart way of streamlining your work, so that you don't have to repeatedly type out the same code. It seems like utilizing snippets would be a great practice, and something I should get used to and comfortable with, so I plan on using them as much as possible, to kind of get used to creating them, and used to the practice of using them. We also learned a handy Ctrl + D hotkey, which allows you to change multiple instances of the same text, at the same time. After the exercise, I looked up morekeyboard shortcuts and I'm attempting to put them to use, ctrl+Z is a simple, and crucial one. There is no reason to not put some effort into learning some keyboard shortcuts, it can only help the whole process of programming.	

The concepts that were toughest for me to grasp were just really where the semantic tags belonged on the webpage. Without much experience, I just didn't really know what a good spot for an aside, or section would be. It seems fairly basic now as I look at my webpage, and I believe this is something I will get better at as I build more webpages. I also have been looking at the source when I visit webpages, and just seeing how those pages are set up semantically is helping me to have a better grasp on where the semantic tags belong.
