# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to track the software development process very closely. It allows us to know when changes were made, and by who. It allows us to implement changes from different people smoothly. If a certain change created a bug, we can know when the change was made and roll back to a previous version. It allows many people to work on a project separately, and allows them to integrate together smoothly.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch allows you to work with and modify code without modifying the master branch. This lets you implement separate features simultaneously while others are working on features in other branches.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is kind of like saving the changes you just made. A good commit message would clearly, and concisely explain any changes you made since your last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when some sort of error occurs when trying to merge different versions of code together. It seems like there can be quite a few reasons for this. One possibility is when there are two separate versions which modified the same code are trying to merge. This seems like it is one of the most common problems in software development and I look forward to learning how to ease merge conflicts.

Here is my small change.
