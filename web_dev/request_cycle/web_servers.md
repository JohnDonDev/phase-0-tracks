Linux operating systems are free, since it is open source. Linux is intended to be interopable with as many other systems as possible, and to follow as many established computing standards as possible. Linux is generally very popular with servers.

A Virtual Private Server is a piece of disk space & RAM that you can use as a server. This is virtual, you don't know where the hardware is, you just know that you can communicate with it, and it can respond to HTTP requests. Using a VPS is nice because, as the curriculum says, it offers you a safe place to experiment.

A major advantage to using a VPS is that you don't have to use a shared web host. Using a shared server, other websites that are completely unrelated to you will affect the performance of your server. If these other websites get busy, it can slow down the server performance for your site. It is also very cost effective, VPS is just as cheap as shared hosting websites, without the downside.

The main reason you shouldn't log in as a root user on Linux is because of security. The security best practice for windows is to be not logged in as administrator, and utilize User Access Control. This helps to make sure your whole system won't get deleted by a bug, or a virus, because it shouldn't have access to everything. It helps to segment access.
